'react-docgen': major

Migrated to babel toolchain

This is one of the big changes in this new version of react-docgen. It made the code a lot more robust
because there are now finally working TypeScript types for the ASTs.

Another benefit from this change that react-docgen is now a lot faster. ðŸš€ In some
tests an improvement of nearly 50% was seen in comparison to version 5.
