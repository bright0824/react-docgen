`react-docgen` is a highly customizable library that extracts information from
[React](https://reactjs.org/) components and returns this information in a
structured machine readable documentation.

It uses [Babel](https://babel.dev/) to parse the source into an AST and provides
methods to process this AST to extract the desired information. The output /
return value is a JSON blob / JavaScript object.

It provides a default implementation for React components defined via
`React.createClass`, [ES2015 class definitions][classes] or functions (stateless
components). These component definitions must follow certain guidelines in order
to be analyzable (see below for more info).

  react-docgen is a low level tool to extract information about react
  components. If you are searching for a more high level styleguide with nice
  interface try
  [react-styleguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist) or
  any of the other tools listed in the
  [wiki](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen/wiki). (TODO site with all
  tools using react-docgen.)
