# Migrate from v5 to v6

## Usage

### ES modules

`react-docgen` is now a pure ESM package. If you want to find out more about
this check
[this link](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c)

### Node.js

Only Node.js versions 14.18.0 or newer are supported.

### changed `parse()` API

The parse method has only two arguments now.

- `src: string` the code to parse and analyze
- `config: Config` the config on how to parse and analyze the code

```diff
-parse(src, resolver, handlers, importer, options: { filename, ...babelOptions})
+parse(src, { resolver, handlers, importer, filename, babelOptions: {} })
```

The return type of `parse()` is now always an array, even if only one component
is found.

### changed component annotation

Removed support for the `@extends React.Component` annotation on react class
components.

Instead, you can use the new `@component` annotation to mark a component or
define your own annotation by creating a custom
`FindAnnotatedDefinitionsResolver` instance.

### renames

- The handler `flowTypeHandler` was renamed to `codeTypeHandler` because it
  handles Flow and TypeScript
- the handler `propDocBlockHandler` was renamed to `propDocblockHandler` (lower
  case `b`) for consistency
- The named export `handlers` was renamed to `builtinHandlers`
- The named export `resolver` was renamed to `builtinResolvers`
- The named export `importers` was renamed to `builtinImporters`
- The resolver `findAllComponentDefinitions` was renamed to
  `FindAllDefinitionsResolver` and is now a class.

  ```diff
  -const resolver = builtinResolvers.findAllComponentDefinitions
  +const resolver = new builtinResolvers.FindAllDefinitionsResolver()
  ```

- The resolver `findAllExportedComponentDefinitions` was renamed to
  `FindExportedDefinitionsResolver` and is now a class.

  ```diff
  -const resolver = builtinResolvers.findAllExportedComponentDefinitions
  +const resolver = new builtinResolvers.FindExportedDefinitionsResolver()
  ```

- The resolver `findExportedComponentDefinition` was removed. Use
  `FindExportedDefinitionsResolver` with the `limit` option instead.

  > This is still the default resolver.

  ```diff
  -const resolver = builtinResolvers.findExportedComponentDefinition
  +const resolver = new builtinResolvers.FindExportedDefinitionsResolver({ limit: 1 })
  ```

### CLI

The CLI was moved into its own package named `@react-docgen/cli` and is a
complete rewrite with different arguments and options. Compared to the old CLI
these are some of the major differences:

- Does not support input via stdin anymore
- The path argument is now a glob
- `-x, --extension` was removed in favor of globs
- `-e, --exclude` was removed
- `-i, --ignore` now accepts a glob
- `--handler` added
- `--importer` added
- `--failOnWarning` added

Checkout [this page](../reference/cli.mdx) to see all the options.

### TypeScript

`react-docgen` is now written in TypeScript and also provides type definitions
in the published package. If you previously had your own typings for
`react-docgen` you might want to remove or adapt them.

## Integrations

### renames

- The utility `resolveComponentDefinition` was renamed to
  `findComponentDefinition`
- Renamed the method `toObject` to `build` in the DocumentationBuilder

### removals

- The utility `match` was removed. The utility can be replaced by babel helpers
  and is not needed anymore. Also using explicit checks like
  `path.isMemberExpression()` is better for type safety and catching potential
  bugs.

### changed AST

`react-docgen` now uses only the babel toolchain internally and removed the
usage of `ast-types`. This also means that the AST produced by `@babel/parser`
is now not conforming to estree anymore but instead uses the slightly different
babel AST. To see the differences check
[the documentation of the babel parser](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-parser#output).

### removed `ast-types`

The `ast-types` library was removed and is not used anymore. This mainly affects
how an integration can check and work with the AST.

Here are some examples how to migrate certain scenarios to use the babel
toolchain instead of `ast-types`:

```diff
-import { namedTypes as types } from 'ast-types';

-if (types.FunctionExpression.check(path.node)) {}
+if (path.isFunctionExpression()) {}

-const leftPath = path.parent.get('left');
+const leftPath = path.parentPath.get('left');

-functionExpression.get('params').each(paramPath => {})
+functionExpression.get('params').forEach(paramPath => {})


-const first = functionExpression.get('params', 0)
+const first = functionExpression.get('params')[0]
```

### changed resolvers API

TBD

### changed handlers API

The handlers API did not have any major changes. Just be aware that `ast-types`
is not used anymore and will not work.

Here is an example diff of a handler.

```diff
-import { namedTypes as types } from 'ast-types';
+import { Documentation, builtinResolvers } from 'react-docgen';

-export default function(documentation: Documentation, path: NodePath): void {
+export default function(documentation: Documentation, path: builtinResolvers.ComponentNodePath): void {
-  if (types.FunctionExpression.check(path.node)) {
+  if (path.isFunctionExpression()) {
    return;
  }
}
```
