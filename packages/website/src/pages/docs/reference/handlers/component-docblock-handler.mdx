# componentDocblockHandler

Reads the react components leading block comment and adds its content as
description to the documentation. This works on all component types.

## Example

The following component will result in the following documentation

```ts {1-3} filename="component.tsx"
/**
 * This is my component and this is its description.
 */
() => <div />;
```

```json {3} filename="Result"
[
  {
    "description": "This is my component and this is its description."
  }
]
```
